    "Lets build a game. The variable named `guess` in the code below contains a number. This number can be changed at the will of the programmer. The user is asked continually the enter the number. If the number is same as the value stored in variable `guess`, the computer says *Congratulations!*. Otherwise the computer gives hints on whether the entered number is greater or less than the one stored and asks for input again.\n",
